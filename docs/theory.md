# Theoretical Background: Active Inference for Robot Navigation

## Introduction

Active inference is a unified theory of brain function that treats perception, action, and learning as different aspects of the same underlying process: minimizing variational free energy. This document provides the theoretical foundation for our implementation of active inference in robot navigation.

## Core Principles of Active Inference

### 1. The Free Energy Principle

The free energy principle states that biological systems minimize their surprise (or maximize their model evidence) by minimizing variational free energy:

$$F = D_{KL}[q(s)||p(s|o)] - \log p(o)$$

Where:
- $q(s)$ is the approximate posterior over hidden states
- $p(s|o)$ is the true posterior over hidden states given observations
- $p(o)$ is the model evidence
- $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence

### 2. Variational Free Energy

Variational free energy can be decomposed into two terms:

$$F = \underbrace{D_{KL}[q(s)||p(s)]}_{\text{Complexity}} - \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{q(s)}[\log p(o|s)]}_{\text{Accuracy}}$$

- **Complexity**: Measures how much the posterior beliefs deviate from prior beliefs
- **Accuracy**: Measures how well the observations are explained by the current beliefs

### 3. Expected Free Energy

For action selection, we use expected free energy:

$$G(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{q(s,o|\pi)}[\log q(s|\pi) - \log p(s,o)]$$

This can be further decomposed into:

$$G(\pi) = \underbrace{D_{KL}[q(s|\pi)||p(s)]}_{\text{Information Gain}} + \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{q(s,o|\pi)}[-\log p(o|s)]}_{\text{Utility}}$$

## Application to Robot Navigation

### 1. Generative Model

Our generative model consists of:

- **Hidden States** ($s$): Robot position, orientation, obstacle locations, goal states
- **Observations** ($o$): Sensor readings (LIDAR, camera, IMU)
- **Actions** ($a$): Movement commands (forward, backward, left, right)

The generative model defines:
- $p(o|s)$: Observation likelihood
- $p(s'|s,a)$: State transition dynamics
- $p(s)$: Prior over states

### 2. Recognition Model

The recognition model approximates the posterior over hidden states:

$$q(s|o) \approx p(s|o)$$

This is implemented as a neural network that maps observations to belief parameters (mean and variance).

### 3. Policy Selection

Actions are selected to minimize expected free energy:

$$a^* = \arg\min_a G(a)$$

This balances:
- **Information Gain**: Reducing uncertainty about the world state
- **Utility**: Moving toward goals and avoiding obstacles

## Mathematical Implementation

### 1. Belief Updates

Beliefs are updated using variational inference:

$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial q(s)} = 0 \implies q(s) \propto p(s) \exp(\mathbb{E}_{q(s)}[\log p(o|s)])$$

### 2. Action Selection

For each possible action, we compute:

1. Sample next states: $s' \sim p(s'|s,a)$
2. Sample observations: $o' \sim p(o'|s')$
3. Compute recognition posterior: $q(s'|o')$
4. Compute expected free energy: $G(a)$
5. Select action: $a^* = \arg\min_a G(a)$

### 3. Learning

The generative model is updated to minimize variational free energy:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{q(s)}[F]$$

## Advantages of Active Inference

### 1. Uncertainty Handling

Active inference naturally handles uncertainty through probabilistic beliefs, making it robust to noisy sensor data and dynamic environments.

### 2. Adaptive Behavior

The agent continuously updates its beliefs based on new observations, allowing it to adapt to changing environments.

### 3. Exploration vs Exploitation

Expected free energy naturally balances exploration (information gain) and exploitation (utility), leading to efficient navigation strategies.

### 4. Interpretability

The belief states provide interpretable representations of the agent's understanding of the world.

## Comparison with Traditional RL

### Traditional RL Approaches

- **PPO**: Direct policy optimization using policy gradients
- **DQN**: Value-based learning with experience replay

### Active Inference Advantages

1. **Probabilistic World Model**: Maintains uncertainty estimates
2. **Online Learning**: Continuously updates beliefs
3. **Intrinsic Motivation**: Naturally explores to reduce uncertainty
4. **Robustness**: Handles noisy and dynamic environments better

## Implementation Details

### Neural Network Architecture

- **Generative Model**: Multi-layer perceptron for observation and transition models
- **Recognition Model**: Multi-layer perceptron for belief inference
- **Policy Model**: Multi-layer perceptron for action selection

### Training Procedure

1. **Belief Update**: Update recognition model to minimize free energy
2. **Action Selection**: Compute expected free energy for all actions
3. **Model Learning**: Update generative model based on observed transitions
4. **Experience Replay**: Store and replay experiences for stable learning

## Theoretical Contributions

This implementation demonstrates:

1. **Scalability**: Active inference can be applied to complex navigation tasks
2. **Efficiency**: The framework provides efficient exploration strategies
3. **Robustness**: Probabilistic beliefs make the system robust to uncertainty
4. **Adaptability**: Continuous belief updates enable adaptation to changing environments

## Future Directions

1. **Hierarchical Active Inference**: Multi-scale belief representations
2. **Multi-Agent Active Inference**: Coordinated navigation of multiple robots
3. **Real-World Deployment**: Transfer to physical robot platforms
4. **Advanced Generative Models**: More sophisticated world models (e.g., transformers)
